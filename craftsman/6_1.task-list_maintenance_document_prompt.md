> `6_1.task-list_maintenance_document_prompt.md`

This prompt ensures the **TaskList** project is fully documented and maintained, supporting high-quality, scalable, and user-friendly development.

---

## Step 1: Code Documentation

1. **Document Code with JSDoc**:
   - Add JSDoc comments to all public and exported functions, classes, and modules. Include:
     - Parameter descriptions with types.
     - Return types and conditions.
     - Purpose and functionality summaries.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * Calculates the total value of assets in a given category.
      * @param category - The category to calculate the total for.
      * @returns The total value of assets in the specified category.
      */
     function calculateTotal(category: string): number { ... }
     ```
   - Commit the changes with a Conventional Commit message:
     ```
     docs: add JSDoc comments to all exported modules
     ```


## Step 2: Standard Documentation

2. **Create Core Project Documents**:
   - Develop or update:
     - `README.md`: Overview, installation steps, usage, and development guide.
     - `CHANGELOG.md`: Record of changes, following Semantic Versioning.
   - Example structure for `README.md`:
     ```markdown
     # Assets Board

     A web-based app for managing and analyzing financial assets locally.

     ## Features
     - Responsive dashboard.
     - Real-time updates.
     - Data export/import.

     ## Installation
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```
     ```
   - Commit with:
     ```
     docs: update README and CHANGELOG
     ```


## Step 3: Comprehensive Project Documentation

3. **Generate a Project Overview**:
   - Add a `docs` directory with:
     - `overview.md`: Include:
       - Dependencies as a bill of materials.
       - Folder structure as an ASCII tree.
       - High-level architecture diagram (Mermaid.js or similar).
     - Example folder structure:
       ```plaintext
       src/
       ├── components/
       │   ├── Header.ts
       │   └── Footer.ts
       ├── styles/
       │   └── main.css
       ├── index.html
       └── vite.config.ts
       ```
   - Commit with:
     ```
     docs: add project overview and folder structure
     ```

4. **Agent Journal**:
   - Create a `journal.md` to log:
     - Summary of agent work since the project's inception.
     - Insights into key decisions and lessons learned.
   - Example entry:
     ```markdown
     ## Journal

     ### January 20, 2025
     - Completed Playwright E2E setup.
     - Refactored CSS for mobile-first design.
     ```


## Step 4: Final Maintenance and Release

5. **Finalize for Release**:
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with final entries.
   - Increment `package.json` version following Semantic Versioning.
   - Create and push a Git release tag:
     ```bash
     git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable release"
     git push origin v1.0.0
     ```
   - Commit with:
     ```
     chore: prepare v1.0.0 release
     ```
