> `5_1_1.app-name_quality_code_my-first-feature.md`
## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **AppName** application's testing. 


Work on the current directory. Do not create a new one for AppName.

This is a windows machine, be sure your commands are compatible with windows.

Wait for user to confirm terminal commands.

Think deep before generating the code. Ask me for help if you need it.

There are some sample files in your knowledge base.

## Step 1: Create test spec file with happy path

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Create a test spec file at `./tests/my-first-feature.spec.ts`
- Add a playwright test for the my first feature
- use this Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the right page
  - When I do something
  - Then I see the expected result
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 2: Implement other scenarios 

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Add other scenarios to the test spec file
- Use the same Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the right page
  - When I do something
  - Then I see the expected result
  - When I don't do something
  - Then I see the expected result
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```
