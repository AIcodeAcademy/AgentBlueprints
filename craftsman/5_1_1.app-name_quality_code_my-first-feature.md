# 5.1.1 AppName - Quality - Code - My First Feature

> `5_1_1.app-name_quality_code_my-first-feature.md`
## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **AppName** application's testing. 

- Feature number: 1
- ShortCode: `1_my-first-feature`
- User Story: `As a <user role>, I want to be able to <feature description> so that <benefit>`


Work on the current directory. 

This is a windows machine, be sure your commands are compatible with windows.

Use the project guidelines to generate the code following the current coding standards.

Wait for user to confirm terminal commands.

Think deep before generating the prompts, they are meant to be run by another LLM. Ask me for help if you need it.

Read current feature implementation before generating the prompts for testing.

## Step 1: Create test spec file with happy path

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Create a test spec file at `./tests/1_my-first-feature.spec.ts`
- Add a playwright boilerplate using the Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the <right place>
  - When I do something <good>
  - Then I see the <expected result>
- Implement the test scenarios for current source code
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 2: Implement other scenarios 

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Add other scenarios to the test spec file
- Add a playwright boilerplate using the Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the <alternative place>
  - When I do something <alternative>
  - Then I see the <expected result>
- Implement the test scenarios for current source code
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 3: Refactor code

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Using a reasoning model, read the affected code and the test spec file.
- Look for opportunities to improve readability and maintainability.
- Refactor the code and run the tests to ensure the changes are not breaking the feature.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```
