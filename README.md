# Agent Blueprints

Instructions and configuration for Software AI Agents to be used with ChatGPT or other LLMs

## Architect

This is an Architect Agent which generates documentation for a Builder agent to plan the scaffolding and construction of a project.

- You can try it out at [ChatGPT/AlbertoBasalo/Architect](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-677e96c7dcdc819196503d20699efb85-architect)
- Alternatively, you can configure your own ChatGPT or LLM project by adding the `architect.instructions.md` file to your agent's knowledge base or chat history.

## Builder

This is a Builder Agent who will generate a plan for a Craftsman  agent to execute the scaffolding and construction of a project.

- You can use it with Cursor Composer and Claude Sonnet, or any other IDE/LLM with _agentic_ capabilities.

## Craftsman
