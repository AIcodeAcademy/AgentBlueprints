---

## Prompt 5: Create Folder Structure

**Prompt:**
"Create the folder structure as outlined in the design document: `docs/`, `public/`, `src/`, `tests/`, and ensure that all necessary files such as `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `vite.config.ts` are in place."

---

## Prompt 6: Configure NPM Scripts

**Prompt:**
"Add the following npm scripts to `package.json`: `start`, `build`, `dev`, `test`, `lint`, and `check-updates`. Ensure that each script performs the intended action as described in the design document."

## Prompt 7: Create README.md and CHANGELOG.md

**Prompt:**
"Create a `README.md` file that includes project details, setup instructions, and usage information. Initialize a `CHANGELOG.md` file using the conventional changelog format."

---

## Prompt 8: Set Up Playwright for E2E Testing

**Prompt:**
"Install Playwright and set up a basic test suite in the `tests/` directory. Configure the project to run these tests using the `npm test` script."

---

"Implement a theme toggle mechanism that allows switching between light and dark themes. Ensure that the theme preferences are saved and persist across sessions."

---

## Prompt 10: Add Welcome Content to Home Page

**Prompt:**
"Add a welcome page or content that serves as a developer readme at the home page. This content should guide developers on how to contribute to the project."

---

## Prompt 11: Configure Dependency Update Notifications

**Prompt:**
"Set up a script or tool that checks for outdated dependencies and notifies the user. This should be integrated into the `npm run check-updates` script."

---

## Prompt 12: Final Review and Commit

**Prompt:**
"Perform a final review of the project setup to ensure that all requirements are met. Commit the initial scaffolding with a conventional commit message and push the changes to a Git repository."
