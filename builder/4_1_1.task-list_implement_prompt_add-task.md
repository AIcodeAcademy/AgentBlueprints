This is a windows machine, be sure your commands are compatible with windows.

Wait for user to confirm terminal commands.

Think deep before generating the code. Ask me for help if you need it.

## Step 1: Implement Domain

**Prompt:**
```text 
- Create a TaskVO class for the task at `src/domain/task.value-object.ts` to validate the task data
- Create a TaskService class at `src/domain/task.service.ts` to manage the tasks
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 2: Implement Infrastructure

**Prompt:**
```text
- Create a TaskRepository class at `src/infrastructure/task.repository.ts` to persist the tasks
- Create a TaskEventBus class at `src/infrastructure/task.event-bus.ts` to emit events when the tasks are added
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 3: Implement Presentation

**Prompt:**
```text
- Add a button to the main page to open the modal form
- Add a web component modal form to the main page to add a new task
- Add input fields for title, due date and status
- Add a buttons to close or save the modal
- Close the modal when the task is saved or cancelled
- Add a simple list of tasks with title to the main page
