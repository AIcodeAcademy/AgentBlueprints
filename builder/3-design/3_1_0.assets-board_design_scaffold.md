# 3.1.0 AssetsBoard - Design - Plan - Scaffold

> `3_1_0.assets-board_design_scaffold.md`

## Overview
This document outlines the scaffolding design for the **AssetsBoard** application. The scaffold serves as the foundation for development, ensuring best practices, modularity, and maintainability from the start.

No feature implementation is required at this stage.

Only the project setup is required.

A welcome content (like a readme) for developers is enough at the home page.

## Tooling and Configuration

### Code Quality
1. **ESLint**: Enforce consistent coding practices.
2. **Prettier**: Ensure code formatting consistency.
