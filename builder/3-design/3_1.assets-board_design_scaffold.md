# 3.1.0 AssetsBoard - Design - Scaffold

## Overview
This document outlines the scaffolding design for the **AssetsBoard** application. The scaffold serves as the foundation for development, ensuring best practices, modularity, and maintainability from the start.

---

## Project Setup

### Frameworks and Tools
- **Frontend**: Vanilla TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: PicoCSS, with specified fonts and colors.

### Fonts
1. **App Title Logo**: Major Mono Display
2. **Headings and Labels**: Tomorrow
3. **Content and Data**: Consolas or monospace

### Colors
1. **Primary Color**: Lime (for actionable items like buttons and links).
2. **Accent Color**: Cyan (for borders, hover states, and highlights).

---

## Features and Functionality

### Light/Dark Mode Support
- Include a toggle mechanism to switch between light and dark themes.
- Ensure compatibility with the specified fonts and color scheme in both modes.

### Data Management
- Store asset data as JSON objects in the browser's local storage.
- Postpone encryption functionality for later implementation.

### Testing and Development
- Configure **Playwright** for end-to-end testing.
- Ensure robust npm scripts for essential workflows:
  - `start`: Start the Vite dev server.
  - `build`: Build the project for production.
  - `test`: Run Playwright tests.
  - `lint`: Lint the code using ESLint.
  - `check-updates`: Check for outdated dependencies and notify the user.

---

## Tooling and Configuration

### Code Quality
1. **ESLint**: Enforce consistent coding practices.
2. **Prettier**: Ensure code formatting consistency.
   - Prettier will be configured to integrate seamlessly with ESLint.

### Documentation
1. **README.md**: Include details about the project purpose, setup instructions, and usage.
2. **CHANGELOG.md**: Track changes using the conventional changelog format.

### Commit Standards
- Enforce **Conventional Commits** to maintain a structured commit history and enable automated changelog generation.

## Folder Structure
```plaintext
AssetsBoard/
|-- src/                # Source files
|-- public/             # Static assets
|-- tests/              # Playwright test cases
|-- docs/               # Documentation (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
|-- package.json        # Project metadata and scripts
|-- vite.config.ts      # Vite configuration
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement the scaffolding as per this design document.
2. Verify proper setup by running `npm start` and ensuring all scripts execute successfully.
3. Begin development by adhering to the established structure and commit standards.
