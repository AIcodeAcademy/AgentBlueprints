# TaskList User stories

TaskList is a simple web app client only for personal use that helps to manage my tasks.

This is the priority user stories for TaskList.

## Must have

- 1 - As a `user` I want `add a task`	so that `I can keep track of my tasks`
- 2 - As a `user` I want `remove a task`	so that `I can remove a task`
- 3 - As a `user` I want `edit a task`	so that `I can change my mind about a task`
- 4 - As a `user` I want `mark a task as done`	so that `I can save my work done`
- 5 - As a `user` I want `view pending tasks`	so that `I can keep track of work to do`

## Nice to have

- 6 - As a `user` I want `view completed tasks`	so that `I can keep track of work done`
- 7 - As a `user` I want `view tasks grouped by priority`	so that `I can work by priority`
- 8 - As a `user` I want `view tasks sorted by due date`	so that `I can work on urgent tasks first`

## Won't have

- As a `user` I want `share tasks`	so that `I can work with others`
