# 4.1.1 Assets Board - Implement - Prompt - View Financial Status by Category

> `4_1_1.assets-board_implement_prompt_view-financial-status-by-category.md`

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **View Financial Status by Category** feature for the **Assets Board** application. This feature provides a categorized financial dashboard displaying essential metrics and visual indicators for risk and liquidity. The implementation focuses on client-side technologies, using LocalStorage for persistence and PicoCSS for styling.

Work on the current directory.

This is a Windows machine, so ensure compatibility with Windows commands. Confirm terminal commands before execution if needed.

## Step 1: Implement Domain

**Prompt:**
```text
- Create a `CategoryVO` class for category validation at `src/domain/category.value-object.ts`.
  - Ensure it supports the following properties:
    - `name`: string (required).
    - `total`: number (required).
    - `risk`: string (enum: High, Moderate, Low).
    - `liquidity`: string (enum: High, Moderate, Low).
- Create a `CategoryService` class at `src/domain/category.service.ts`.
  - Add methods to retrieve, add, and validate categories.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 2: Implement Infrastructure

**Prompt:**
```text
- Create a `CategoryRepository` class at `src/infrastructure/category.repository.ts` to handle LocalStorage interactions.
  - Implement methods to:
    - Save categories.
    - Retrieve categories.
    - Update categories.
- Create a `CategoryEventBus` class at `src/infrastructure/category.event-bus.ts` to handle reactive updates.
  - Emit events when categories are added, removed, or updated.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 3: Implement Presentation

**Prompt:**
```text
- Create a dashboard web component at `src/presentation/dashboard.component.ts`.
  - Display categories as cards with the following details:
    - **Category Name**.
    - **Total Financial Value**.
    - **Risk Level**: Styled with color coding (e.g., green, yellow, red).
    - **Liquidity Level**: Styled with color coding (e.g., blue, orange, gray).
  - Add hover/tap interactivity for better visibility.
- Bind the component to the `CategoryService` to reactively display changes.
- Use PicoCSS and custom CSS variables for styling.
  - Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile.
  - Use the following fonts:
    - `Major Mono Display` for headers.
    - `Tomorrow` for labels.
    - `Consolas` or monospace for data.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Notes for Developers
- Test the application in a local browser environment to ensure data persistence and visual responsiveness.
- Validate data in the domain layer to prevent invalid inputs.
- Use mock data initially, as outlined in the design document, for testing.
- Future enhancements can include dynamic data entry and API integrations.
