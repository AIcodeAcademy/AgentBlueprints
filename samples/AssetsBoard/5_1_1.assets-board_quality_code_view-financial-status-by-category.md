## Step 1: Create Test Spec File for Happy Path

### Prompt:
```text
- Create a test spec file at `./tests/view-financial-status.spec.ts`.
- Add a Playwright test for the "View Financial Status by Category" feature.
- Follow this Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the dashboard page,
  - When I load the page,
  - Then I see category cards for "Crypto", "Stocks", and "Real Estate".
  - When I click on a card,
  - Then I see the card highlighted with no additional data displayed.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits:
```

## Step 2: Add Edge Case Scenarios

### Prompt:
```text
- Extend the test spec file `view-financial-status.spec.ts` to include edge cases.
- Follow this Gherkin syntax for scenarios:
  - Scenario: Dashboard with no categories
    - Given there are no categories in the data,
    - When I load the dashboard page,
    - Then I see an empty state message "No categories available."

  - Scenario: Category with zero total value
    - Given the "Real Estate" category has a total value of $0,
    - When I load the dashboard page,
    - Then I see the "Real Estate" card displayed with a total of $0.

  - Scenario: Missing risk and liquidity flags
    - Given a category "Savings" with no risk or liquidity flags,
    - When I load the dashboard page,
    - Then I see the "Savings" card with "N/A" for both risk and liquidity.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits
```



## Step 3: Configure Test Environment

### Prompt:
```text
- Ensure Playwright is correctly configured for the testing environment.
- Update the `playwright.config.ts` file to include:
  - Base URL for the application.
  - Default timeout for tests.
  - Test reporter for readable output.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits
```



## Notes

- Validate tests in both desktop and mobile viewports to ensure responsive behavior.
- Use mock data for tests based on the design document:
  ```json
  [
    { "name": "Crypto", "total": 15000, "risk": "High", "liquidity": "Moderate" },
    { "name": "Stocks", "total": 20000, "risk": "Moderate", "liquidity": "High" },
    { "name": "Real Estate", "total": 50000, "risk": "Low", "liquidity": "Low" }
  ]
  ```
- Ensure each test scenario is isolated and independent to simplify debugging.
