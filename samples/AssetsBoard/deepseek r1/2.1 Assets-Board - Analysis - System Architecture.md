# 2.1 Assets-Board - Analysis - System Architecture

> `2_1.assets-board_analysis_system-architecture.md`

This document outlines the system architecture for the **Assets-Board** application, a client-only web app for tracking personal financial assets with real-time valuation and categorization.

## System Overview

The solution will consist of the following key **components**:

### Front End  
- **SPA** built with **TypeScript** and **Vite**.  
- **Web Components** (no external frameworks).  
- **PicoCSS** for minimal styling (custom resets, semantic HTML with no utility classes).  
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing.  
- Responsive layout with dark/light mode support.  

### Back End  
- None (client-only app).  

### Database  
- `localStorage` with two keys:  
  - `assets`: JSON array of asset objects (fields: `id`, `name`, `category`, `quantity`, `unitValue`, `date`).  
  - `categories`: JSON array of category objects (fields: `id`, `name`, `risk`, `liquidity`).  
- IDs generated as slugs (e.g., `real-estate`).  

### Server  
- Static file hosting via **Vite Preview**.  

### Security  
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted/decrypted using a user-provided password (Web Crypto API).  
- Password required at app startup to access data.  

### Integrations  
- CSV import/export for asset and category data (client-side parser).
