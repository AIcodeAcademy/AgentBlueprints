# 3.1.0 Assets-Board - Design - Plan - Scaffold

> `3_1_0.assets-board_design_scaffold.md`

## Overview

This document outlines the scaffolding design for the **Assets-Board** application. The scaffold serves as the foundation for development, ensuring best practices, modularity, and maintainability from the start.

No feature implementation is required at this stage.  
Only the project setup is required.  
A welcome page (e.g., a readme) for developers is sufficient for the initial homepage.
