## Overview

This document outlines the scaffolding design for the **Assets Board** application. The scaffold serves as the foundation for development, ensuring best practices, modularity, and maintainability from the start.

No feature implementation is required at this stage.

Only the project setup is required.

A welcome content (like a README) for developers is enough at the home page.

## Frontend

### Frameworks and Tools
- **Version Control**: Git with Conventional Commits.
- **Dependency Management**: NPM, with update notifications.

## Backend

- details

## Database

- Local storage, nothing to do at this stage

## Server
