# 2.1 Assets Board - Analysis - System Architecture

`2_1.assets-board_analysis_system-architecture.md`

This document outlines the system architecture for the **Assets Board** web application. The architecture is designed to support the app's core features while ensuring simplicity, security, and ease of use.

## System Overview

The solution consists of the following key components:

### Front End
- **Description**: A responsive web client providing users with a clean and intuitive interface to manage and visualize financial assets.
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - Language: Standard TypeScript.
  - Styling: PicoCSS for lightweight and simple styling.
  - Development Server: Vite for a fast and efficient development environment.
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing with Playwright.

### Back End
- **Description**: No back-end server is used. All logic and data storage are handled entirely on the client side.

### Database
- **Description**: Local storage for user-inputted financial data.
- **Approach**: Data is stored securely in the browser using local storage APIs.

### Security
- Password-based encryption for sensitive data handled within the client.
- Regular testing to ensure data integrity.

### Integrations
- CSV handling for data export and import functionality.
- Basic charting functionality implemented via lightweight libraries or custom logic.

### Deployment
- **Deployment Environment**: Hosted and run locally using Vite's development server. The user, also a developer, will deploy and maintain the application directly.
- **No Back-End Requirements**: Ensures minimal infrastructure and simplicity.

    Person(User, "Developer/User", "Develops and uses the web app to manage financial assets.")
    System(WebApp, "Assets Board", "Manages user data, categories, and charts.")
    SystemBoundary(WebApp, "Assets Board System") {
        Container(WebClient, "Front End", "TypeScript-based responsive client.")
        ContainerDb(Database, "Local Storage", "Stores user data securely in the browser.")
    }
    Rel(User, WebClient, "Interacts with")
    Rel(WebClient, Database, "Reads/Writes")
```

## Next Steps

1. Finalize the implementation details for the TypeScript front end.
2. Design a secure approach for password-based encryption.
3. Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing.
4. Plan and implement CSV handling functionality.
5. Deploy and test the application locally using Vite.
