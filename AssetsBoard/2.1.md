# AssetsBoard Architecture

This document outlines the system architecture for the AssetsBoard application.

## System Overview

AssetsBoard is a web application for personal use designed to help users track financial assets and investments. It will consist of the following key components:

- **Front-End**: A responsive web interface for managing assets.
- **Back-End**: No dedicated server; the application will use static hosting.
- **Database**: Local storage for saving asset data, optionally encrypted.
- **API Integration**: Integration with CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency data (nice-to-have).

## Implementation Style

- **Architecture**: Single-page application (SPA) hosted on a static file server.
- **Data Handling**: Store all user data locally using browser storage (e.g., IndexedDB or LocalStorage).
- **Security**: Data will be encrypted locally for enhanced security.
- **Performance**: Optimized for small datasets with minimal computation needs.
- **Maintainability**: Designed as a lightweight project manageable by a single part-time developer.

## Deployment Environment

- Hosted on a static web hosting platform, such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Future Considerations

- Allow exporting data as JSON for backups.
- Enable scalability for optional cloud storage or advanced integrations.
