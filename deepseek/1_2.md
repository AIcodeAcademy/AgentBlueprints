# FinTrack System Architecture

**1. Frontend Layer**  
- **Web**: React.js with responsive UI for dashboards, charts, and forms.  
- **Mobile**: Native apps using Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) for offline sync and push notifications.  
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API for React; Jetpack Compose/SwiftUI for mobile.  

**2. Backend Layer**  
- **Framework**: Python/Django for RESTful API endpoints and business logic.  
- **Microservices**: Separate services for account aggregation, budget calculations, and report generation.  
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with JWT tokens and role-based access control (RBAC).  

**3. Data Layer**  
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for structured financial data (transactions, user profiles).  
- **Cache**: Redis for frequent queries (e.g., net worth updates).  
- **Cloud Storage**: Firebase Cloud Storage or AWS S3 for PDF/Excel reports.  

**4. Integration Layer**  
- **Bank/Crypto APIs**: Plaid for banking data, CoinMarketCap for crypto prices.  
- **Third-Party Services**: Twilio for SMS alerts, SendGrid for email notifications.  

**5. Security & Compliance**  
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit.  
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA adherence via user consent management and data anonymization.  
- **Audits**: Regular penetration testing and automated vulnerability scans.  

**6. Infrastructure & DevOps**  
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS EC2 or Google Cloud for backend; Firebase Hosting for the web app.  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions/Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for performance metrics; Sentry for error tracking.

### Standardized System Architecture Template  
1. **Frontend**: Framework (e.g., React, Angular), platforms (web, iOS, Android).  
2. **Backend**: Language/framework (e.g., Node.js, Django), API design (REST/GraphQL).  
3. **Database**: Type (SQL/NoSQL), caching strategy.  
4. **Integrations**: Third-party APIs (payment gateways, analytics).  
5. **Security**: Encryption standards, compliance requirements.  
6. **Infrastructure**: Hosting provider, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring tools.  
7. **Scalability**: Load balancing, auto-scaling, database sharding.
