# **AI Coding Prompts for FinTrack Scaffolding**  
**Execution Order**: Follow sequentially for dependencies (e.g., backend before frontend integrations).  

---

## **1. Project Setup & Configuration**  
1. **Initialize Frontend Repositories**  
   - "Create a React.js project named `fintrack-web` with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and React Router."  
   - "Initialize a Swift iOS project `fintrack-ios` using SwiftUI and Core Data for offline storage."  
   - "Initialize a Kotlin Android project `fintrack-android` using Jetpack Compose and Room Database."  

2. **Backend Foundation**  
   - "Set up a Django project `fintrack-api` with Django REST Framework (DRF) and JWT authentication."  
   - "Configure PostgreSQL and Redis in `settings.py` using `django-environ` for environment variables."  

---

## **2. Frontend Scaffolding**  
3. **Web Dashboard**  
   - "Scaffold a React.js dashboard layout with a sidebar menu (Accounts, Net Worth, Budgets) and a main content area."  
   - "Integrate Chart.js to display a line graph for net worth trends. Fetch mock data from a JSON file."  
   - "Build a form using Formik for manual transaction input with fields: date, amount, category, and description."  

4. **Mobile Views**  
   - "Implement a SwiftUI view in `fintrack-ios` showing a budget progress bar with dynamic updates from mock data."  
   - "Create a Jetpack Compose screen in `fintrack-android` to display account balances in a scrollable list."  
   - "Add navigation drawers to both mobile apps with tabs for Dashboard, Alerts, and Reports."  

---

## **3. Backend Microservices**  
5. **Account Aggregation**  
   - "Create a Django app `accounts` with a model for financial institutions (name, API key, user_id)."  
   - "Write a Python script to fetch transactions via Plaid API and normalize data into PostgreSQL. Handle rate limits with retry logic."  
   - "Add a `/sync-accounts` endpoint in DRF to trigger manual data synchronization."  

6. **Budget Engine**  
   - "Build a Django model `Budget` with fields: user_id, category, limit, alert_threshold."  
   - "Implement a cron job to check daily spending against limits and trigger alerts via Twilio/SendGrid."  

7. **Report Generator**  
   - "Use Pandas in a Django service to aggregate monthly expenses. Output PDF reports using ReportLab and store them in AWS S3."  

---

## **4. Data Layer & Integrations**  
8. **Database Setup**  
   - "Define PostgreSQL schemas for `User`, `Account`, `Transaction`, and `Budget` tables with Django migrations."  
   - "Configure Redis caching for the net worth calculator to refresh every 15 minutes."  

9. **Third-Party APIs**  
   - "Integrate Plaid API into `fintrack-api` for bank account syncing. Use `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` and `PLAID_SECRET` environment variables."  
   - "Connect CoinMarketCap API to fetch real-time crypto prices. Cache results in Redis to avoid rate limits."  
   - "Set up Twilio and SendGrid in Django for SMS/email alerts using environment variables for API keys."  

---

## **5. Security & Authentication**  
10. **User Authentication**  
    - "Implement Firebase Auth in Django with JWT tokens. Add role-based access control (RBAC) for `user`, `admin`, and `advisor` roles."  
    - "Secure API endpoints with Django REST Framework permissions (IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser)."  

11. **Encryption & Compliance**  
    - "Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., API keys) in PostgreSQL using Django’s `Fernet` encryption."  
    - "Add GDPR consent logs: create a model `UserConsent` to track data-sharing permissions."  

---

## **6. DevOps & Infrastructure**  
12. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
    - "Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run pytest for Django and deploy to AWS EC2 on pushes to `main`."  
    - "Configure Firebase Hosting for the React.js web app with automated deploys from the `production` branch."  

13. **Monitoring & Alerts**  
    - "Set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor API latency. Alert if response time exceeds 500ms."  
    - "Integrate Sentry for error tracking in Django and React.js with environment-specific configurations."  

---

## **7. Feature Implementation**  
14. **Net Worth Calculator**  
    - "Write a Django service to calculate net worth (assets - liabilities) and cache results in Redis. Expose via a `/net-worth` endpoint."  
    - "Connect the React.js dashboard to the `/net-worth` API and display real-time updates using WebSocket or polling."  

15. **Budget Alerts**  
    - "Build a React.js component to show budget progress bars. Fetch data from `/budgets` API and highlight over-limit categories in red."  
    - "Implement push notifications in mobile apps using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for budget breaches."  

---

## **8. Testing & Error Handling**  
16. **Test Suites**  
    - "Write pytest cases for Django API endpoints (200 OK, 401 Unauthorized, 400 Bad Request)."  
    - "Add Jest/React Testing Library tests for the dashboard’s Chart.js rendering and form validation."  

17. **Error Recovery**  
    - "Add retry logic in the Plaid API service to handle expired tokens and rate limits."  
    - "Implement offline data sync in mobile apps using Core Data/Room Database. Queue requests and retry on reconnect."

**Usage Instructions**:  
1. Copy prompts individually or follow the sequence for dependencies.  
2. Replace placeholders (e.g., `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET`) with actual values.  
3. Run backend services before frontend API integrations.  

This structure ensures modularity while maintaining logical progression for scaffolding the solution.
