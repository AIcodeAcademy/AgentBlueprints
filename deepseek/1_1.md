**Example Briefing Document: Personal Financial Assets Manager**  
**Project Name**: "FinTrack" – Personal Financial Portfolio Tracker  

---  
**1. Project Overview**  
Develop a web/mobile app to help users track personal financial assets (bank accounts, investments, crypto, loans) in one dashboard. Core value: real-time net worth visualization, budget alerts, and expense categorization.  

**2. Objectives**  
- Allow users to manually input or auto-sync accounts from banks/brokerages.  
- Provide visual dashboards (charts, trends) for income, expenses, and net worth.  
- Enable secure, role-based access (e.g., family members or financial advisors).  
- Launch a minimum viable product (MVP) within 6 months.  

**3. Target Audience**  
- Individuals aged 25–55 managing multiple financial accounts.  
- Small business owners tracking personal and business finances.  

**4. Key Features (MVP Scope)**  
- **Account Aggregation**: API integrations with banks/CoinMarketCap.  
- **Net Worth Calculator**: Auto-updating total assets vs. liabilities.  
- **Budget Tools**: Customizable spending limits with SMS/email alerts.  
- **Report Generation**: Exportable PDF/Excel summaries.  
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Web, iOS, and Android with cloud backup.  

**5. Technical Requirements**  
- **Frontend**: React.js for web, Swift/Kotlin for mobile.  
- **Backend**: Python/Django, RESTful APIs.  
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, GDPR/CCPA compliance.  
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Plaid API (banking), Firebase (auth).  

**6. Timeline & Budget**  
- **Discovery (2 weeks)**: Finalize feature list and APIs.  
- **Development (20 weeks)**: Agile sprints with biweekly demos.  
- **Testing (4 weeks)**: User acceptance testing (UAT) and security audits.  
- **Budget**: $120K–$150K (development, tools, licenses).  

**7. Stakeholders**  
- Product Owner: Jane Doe (jane@fintrack.com).  
- Dev Team: Outsourced agency "TechFlow Solutions".  
- Legal/Compliance: Internal team for data privacy review.  

**8. Risks & Assumptions**  
- **Risks**: Bank API rate limits, delayed regulatory approvals.  
- **Assumptions**: Users will grant access to financial accounts; no cryptocurrency tax logic required in MVP.

## **Questions to Gather Information** (for future standardization):  


1. **Technical Deep Dive**  
   - Are there **performance benchmarks** (e.g., response time for real-time net worth updates)?  
   - How should the system handle **data synchronization conflicts** (e.g., offline edits vs. cloud data)?  
   - What are the **scaling requirements** for concurrent users or data volume (e.g., 10k vs. 1M users)?  

2. **User Experience & Design**  
   - Are there **accessibility standards** (e.g., WCAG 2.1) or localization needs (multi-language/currency)?  
   - Do users expect **customizable dashboards** (e.g., drag-and-drop widgets) in the MVP?  
   - Should the app include **onboarding tutorials** or tooltips for first-time users?  

3. **Post-MVP & Longevity**  
   - Are there plans for **future integrations** (e.g., tax software, AI-driven insights) post-launch?  
   - What is the strategy for **handling deprecated APIs** (e.g., bank API changes)?  
   - How will **software updates** be managed (e.g., automatic vs. user-initiated)?  

4. **Team & Process**  
   - Does the development team have **prior experience** with financial data encryption or compliance?  
   - Are there **documentation requirements** (e.g., API specs, architecture diagrams) for handover?  
   - Will there be a **dedicated DevOps/SRE team** for post-launch monitoring and maintenance?  

5. **Edge Cases & Risk Mitigation**  
   - How should the system handle **stale or disconnected financial data** (e.g., expired API tokens)?  
   - What are fallback mechanisms if **third-party APIs** (e.g., Plaid) experience downtime?  
   - Are there plans for **user data portability** (e.g., GDPR’s "right to data download")?  

6. **Business & Compliance**  
   - Are there **audit requirements** (e.g., SOC 2) beyond GDPR/CCPA?  
   - Will the app need to support **multi-entity accounts** (e.g., family businesses with shared access)?  
   - Are there **legal restrictions** on data storage (e.g., EU data must reside in the EU)?
