### 5.1.0 Assets Board - Quality - Scaffolding Prompts with File Samples

> `5_1_0.assets-board_quality_code_scaffold.md`

This document outlines the scaffolding prompts for implementing quality measures for the **Assets Board** application. The scaffolding focuses on setting up essential tools and configurations to ensure the codebase is tested, maintainable, and aligns with best practices. Additionally, it includes file samples for configuration and rules.

---

## Step 1: Add Playwright for E2E Tests

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Ensure you work in the current directory. Avoid creating new directories.
- Install Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) testing.
- Configure Playwright to store test specifications and outputs in a `./tests` directory.
- Ensure the test output directories are ignored in Git using `.gitignore`.
- Set up Playwright to use the URL and port from `vite.config.ts`.
- Create and execute a basic smoke test to validate the setup.
- Add a custom NPM test script to automate test execution.
- Commit all changes following the Conventional Commits standard.
```

---

## Step 2: Configure ESLint and Prettier for Code Quality

**Prompt:**
```text
- Install and configure ESLint for TypeScript compatibility.
- Install Prettier and integrate it seamlessly with ESLint.
- Ensure Prettier handles code formatting, with ESLint focusing on linting rules.
- Add NPM scripts for linting and formatting tasks.
- Commit the changes with proper Conventional Commit messages.
```

---

## Step 3: IDE AI Configuration for Developer Assistance

**Prompt:**
```text
- Create IDE-specific configuration files such as `.cursorrules` or `.windsurfconfig` to guide AI behavior in developer tools.
- Use existing project knowledge to include examples of code style and prompts for AI integrations.
- Ensure the configurations align with the team’s workflows and preferences.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Extra Section: File Samples as context

Below are file samples to guide the setup of rules and configurations:

### 1. `.eslintrc.json`
```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "prettier"
  ],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 12,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "plugins": [
    "@typescript-eslint"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "warn",
    "semi": ["error", "always"],
    "quotes": ["error", "single"]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. `.prettierrc`
```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false
}
```

---

### 3. `.gitignore`
```text
# Dependencies
node_modules/
dist/

# Testing output
tests/output/

# Environment variables
.env
```

---

### 4. Playwright Smoke Test (`tests/smoke.test.ts`)
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic smoke test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');
  expect(await page.title()).toBe('Assets Board');
});
```

---

### 5. `vite.config.ts`
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 5173
  }
});
```

---

### 6. `.cursorrules` (IDE AI Behavior)
```markdown
# Git Rules
- Use Conventional Commits format:
  - feat: new features
  - fix: bug fixes
  - docs: documentation changes
  - style: formatting changes
  - refactor: code restructuring
  - test: adding/modifying tests
  - chore: maintenance tasks
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- No feature branches required
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Update CHANGELOG.md with feat and fix entries

# Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable and function names 
- When OOP, follow SOLID principles
- When functional, favor pure functions and immutable data
  
# TypeScript Rules
- Use explicit types for variables, functions, parameters, and return values
- Prefer type aliases over interfaces for object types
- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Implement proper error handling with custom error classes

# CSS Rules
- Use PicoCSS framework implicit classes-less approach
- Use sematic HTML, PicoCSS will handle the styles
- Customize PicoCSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- In case of custom classes, follow BEM naming convention in global scope

## E2ETesting
- Use Playwright for e2e tests
- Prefer content-based over tag-based selection
- Follow AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern
- Name variables with: inputX, fakeX, actualX,expectedX
- Use meaningful input and mock data
- Configure output folders inside tests folder


```
