   - **Styling**:
     - Card-based layout with color coding for risk and liquidity levels:
       - **Risk**: Green for Low, Yellow for Moderate, Red for High.
       - **Liquidity**: Blue for High, Orange for Moderate, Gray for Low.

## Infrastructure

### Storage
- Use LocalStorage for mock data persistence.
- Hardcoded data is read from LocalStorage on page load.

### Reactive Updates
- Bind the dashboard display to LocalStorage updates to ensure an immediate refresh when data changes.

## Notes for Future Enhancements
- Enable users to dynamically add, edit, or delete categories.
- Allow customization of risk and liquidity thresholds.
- Add detailed views for categories with breakdowns of individual assets.
- Replace hardcoded data with user input or integration with real-time APIs.
