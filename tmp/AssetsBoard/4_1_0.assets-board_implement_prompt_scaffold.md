> `4_1_0.assets-board_implement_prompt_scaffold.md`

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **Assets Board** application's scaffolding.

No feature implementation is required at this stage.

Work on the current directory. Do not create a new one for Assets Board.

This is a Windows machine, so ensure all commands are compatible with Windows.

Think carefully before generating the code. Ask for clarification if needed.

## Step 1: Initialize Git and NPM Repository

**Prompt:**
```text
- Work on the current directory.
- Initialize a new Git repository for the Assets Board project.
- Set up a `.gitignore` file for common web development files (e.g., `node_modules`, `dist`, etc.).
- Initialize the NPM package manager.
- Install npm-check-updates.
- Add NPM scripts to check for and install updates in the project.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 2: Set Up Vite Project with TypeScript

**Prompt:**
```text
- Use the terminal to create a new Vite project with TypeScript support by using the `vanilla-ts` template from the template registry.
- Install the dependencies at their latest versions.
- Configure TypeScript using the `tsconfig.json` file.
- Add NPM scripts for `dev`, `build`, and `start` tasks.
- Create a basic `README.md` file with project details.
- Verify the project works.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 3: Add Pico CSS Styles

**Prompt:**
```text
- Install PicoCSS via NPM.
- Import PicoCSS into the `styles.css` file.

- Import the fonts into `styles.css`.
- Configure the following styles:
  - Major Mono Display for the logo.
  - Tomorrow for headings and labels.
  - Consolas or monospace for data and text.
  - Lime as the primary color.
  - Cyan as the secondary color.
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 4: Create a Welcome Developer Page

**Prompt:**
```text
- Create a `Header` web component with the name of the project as the logo.
- Create a `Footer` web component with the year and copyright.
- Create a `HomePage` web component that includes the `Header` and `Footer`.
