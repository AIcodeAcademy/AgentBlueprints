> `3_1_1.task-list_design_add-task.md`

## Overview

This document outlines the design for the **Add Task** feature for the **TaskList** application.

- Feature number: 1
- ShortCode: `1_add-task`

## Frontend

### Presentation

- A modal form to add a new task
- The modal is opened by a button in the main page
- The modal is closed by a button in the modal
- The form should be validated before saving the task
  - The title is required
  - The due date is optional, but if provided, it must be in the future
- The main page should be updated with the new task added
  - For feedback and testing, a simple list of tasks with title is enough by now

### Domain

- A task is a structure with a
  - title: short string
  - due date: date (optional) in the future
  - status: string (enum: `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`)
- The task is added to the tasks array, with a unique id (a timestamp)
- No other logic is required at this stage

### Infrastructure

- The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage
- Any change is reactively propagated to the UI
- Local storage is enough.
