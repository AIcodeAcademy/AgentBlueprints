# 5.1.1 TaskList - Quality - Code - Add Task

> `5_1_1.task-list_quality_code_add-task.md`
## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **TaskList** application's testing. 


Work on the current directory. Do not create a new one for TaskList.

This is a windows machine, be sure your commands are compatible with windows.

Wait for user to confirm terminal commands.

Think deep before generating the code. Ask me for help if you need it.

There are some sample files in your knowledge base.

## Step 1: Create test spec file with happy path

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Create a test spec file at `./tests/add-task.spec.ts`
- Add a playwright test for the add task feature
- use this Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the main page
  - When I click the add task button
  - Then I see the task form
  - When I fill in the task form
  - Then I the save button is enabled
  - When I click the save button
  - Then I see the main page with the new task
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```

## Step 2: Implement other scenarios

**Prompt:** 
```text
- Add other scenarios to the test spec file
- Use the same Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the main page
  - When I click the add task button
  - Then I see the task form
  - When I don't fill the task correctly
  - Then I see the task form with errors
  - When I click the save button
  - Then I the task is not added
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
```
